# Track my energy usage

Based on a starting template for React, NextJS, TypeScript: https://github.com/alepacheco/landing-template

I added a GitHub action to build/test/lint the project and will deploy it to Now.sh if everything passes!
Check it out: https://energy-usage.harrymt.now.sh/


## Run

```
$ yarn dev
```

## Test

```
$ yarn test
```
