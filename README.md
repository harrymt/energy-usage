# Track my energy usage

Graph to show my next energy usage based on estimated usage.

Based on a starting template for React, NextJS, TypeScript: https://github.com/alepacheco/landing-template

I added a GitHub action to build/test/lint the project and will deploy it to Now.sh if everything passes!
